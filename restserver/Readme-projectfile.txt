Comments:
The coding project contains three important parts:
1. Implementing JSON as a data format.
2. Utilize GET + POST HTTP Methods.
3. The project is written using Maven....it is Complied + Tested by using Maven....I understand the testing code is to be written using unit testing
but since the project is written using Maven....I hope the test feature using Maven Test would substitute unit testing and the project be accepted for
valuation.
